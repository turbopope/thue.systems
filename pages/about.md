## About Thue

Think of Sudoku, except it's letters instead of numbers and you don't solve Sudokus but you solve thue problems. Okay, it's not like Sudoku, but it's a puzzle-game like Sudoku, alright? So, like in any puzzle game worth it's money (and note that Thue is free, make of that what you want) you have to use your **brain** to solve the problems presented to you. In the case of Thue, these problems are what we Computer Scientists call **string rewriting problems**. Sounds boring, but once you know how it works it's highly addicting (gaming-addiction is a good thing now, right?).

Here is how it works: Each stage of the game is a thue **System**. A System has a word that needs to be rewritten to a target word and a set of rewriting-**Rules**. You try to apply these rules in the right order to transform the starting word to the target word (the combination of the word to rewrite and the target word is called the **Problem**). That's it.

Now, we expect that there are two types people in the world: Those who understood some of the above and want to experience the game's glory for themselfes right now. And those to whom the above wall all gibberish. Luckily, we do have a solution for both types of you: Go to the Home Page or [click here]({{ site.latest_version.dropbox_link }}) to download the latest version of Thue for your Android Smartphone and *just start playing*. If you need help with that, please refer to [The Tutorial](/tutorial/) or just mess around until it all starts to make sense to you. Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it eventually.

For those who want to know what in the name of Alan Turing a NP-hard problem is or just want to see where we stole the idea for the game from, please refer to [the Wikipedia Article on Semi-Thue systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-Thue_system). They'll do a much better job on explaining it than I ever could (after all I needed to write myself an App in order to learn to solve these problems and pass my exam on theoretical computer science).
