## About Us

We are a Computer Science Student and a Computer Visualistics Student from [Koblenz, Germany](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Koblenz/@50.3454273,7.5885547,12z/), interested in good design and games. You can probably see where the inspiration for this game came from. Together we founded\* our games-company **turbopope** this year with the intention to create beautiful games and establish a name for ourselves.

<small>\*We mean *founded* in an abstract, more *spiritual* sense here, since we didn't actually register a trade or anything yet.</small>

**Marco Brack** is a Computer Science student in Koblenz since 2012 and is currently working on his master's thesis. His studies focus on Data and Knowledge Engineering, but his expertise lies wherever code needs to be written. Bla bla bla.

**Mark Oliver Olegowitsh Mints** is a Computer Visualistics student in Koblenz since 2014 and currently pursues his Bachelor's Degree. Computer Visualistics is a very rare degree program in Germany, but it produces graduates which are apt to programming at the interface between graphics and logic. **Mark's** primary task at **turbopope** is designung Thue's visuals.


### Why Are You Doing This?

Three reasons:

**Portfolio** -- Having a Master of Science Degree is one thing, but having the actual skills one would usually expect from such graduates is unfortunately often a completely different thing. So even if Thue is not the big success we would like it to be, having something like a modern app and a fancy website to show for is certainly an asset in our future CVs.

\$\$\$ **Money** \$\$\$ -- (Actually, those should probably be euro-signs, but the dollar is more iconic) Mobile Games are big and we would be lying if we were to claim that we weren't interested in cashing in on those people who, for the first time in the (admittedly short) history of video-gaming, have easy access to all kinds of games. We don't think that this is a bad thing though.

**Fun** -- It may sound like a platitude at this point of the article, but we actually enjoy the development process of Thue. Playing around with [Unity](https://unity3d.com/), our game engine, has so far been a wonderful experience that introduced us to the beautiful [programming language C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) and has enabled us to express our creativity in ways we previously could not imagine, which is a great thing if you are a student with a head full of ideas, and a schedule full of lectures and exams.
