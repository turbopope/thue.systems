## Development Diary

In a cowardly attempt to fake some interest in the gaming-community and all that good stuff, we'll try to post some blog-like articles here to keep our surely fast-growing player-base updated about the latest developments at turbopope headquarters.

But in all seriousness, posts will probably be a very irregular thing that serve the sole purpose of reminding ourselfes that game-development is in fact a very community-driven activity and if we want any success with Thue we'd better start generating some momentum for that hype. Also, who doesn't like to keep a diary so they can one day look back on their foolish endeavours of the past and be like "Well, I guess that is a thing that didn't work out as expected"?
