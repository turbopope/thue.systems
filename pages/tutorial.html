<h2>How to Play</h2>

<p>
  Until we can be bothered to include an actual tutorial in the game, here is a small guide on what you are supposed to do with those cute little blocky things.

      The goal of the Thue is to transform one "<strong>Word</strong>" into another. A Word consists of multiple <strong>Symbols</strong>, which is our technical term for "cute little blocky things". We would have called them letters, but we wanted to be able to use other characters or images or whatever to compose Words, hence the name. The two top-most Words constitute the <strong>Problem</strong>, with the current Word on top (<code>bb</code> in the example) and the elusive target Word beneath (<code>yx</code>).

      The remaining Word-pairs below the Problem are <strong>Rules</strong>. You apply them to rewrite the current Word until it is equal to the target Word. By applying a rule you replace the left Word of the Rule in the current Word by the right Word of the Rule. Touch a Rule to select it (<code>bb > yx</code> in the example) and touch the current Word where you want to apply the rule. Possible locations are highlighted. Hint: If there is only one possible location, you can just touch the Rule again.

  </div>
  <div class="col offset-l2 l6">
    <p>
      As you can see, <code>bb</code> in the current Word has been replaced by <code>yx</code> from the Rule and now the current Word is equal to the target Word. This example was trivial, but finding the correct sequence of Rule applications can be quite tricky, since you must plan ahead. Also, you might have to apply Rules multiple times and since we're dickheads some rules are there purely to mislead you.
